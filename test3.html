          <b>2. HTML & CSS HTML</b>- is one of the first you should learn.
          Thanks to HTML, the web browsers know what to show once they receive
          the request. If you want to better understand how HTML works, you also
          need to know what CSS is. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it
          describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on the screen. If you
          browse enough tutorials, you’ll soon create CSS text effects, page
          transitions, image hover effects, and more. If you’re a complete
          beginner, this Essential HTML & CSS training by James Williamson will
          help you to quickly get started with these technologies.
